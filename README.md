# [GIDInd](https://www.if.tugraz.at/amd/GIDInd/) 

### A MATLAB application for automated indexing of grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) images.

## Features
- Indexing based on two components of the scattering vectors: the in-plane parts (q<sub>xy</sub>) and the out-of plane parts (q<sub>z</sub>)
- Indexing with and without consideration of the specular diffraction peak
- Determination of triclinic unit cell
- Determination of the crystallographic contact plane parallel to the substrate surface 
- The lattice constants of the unit cell can be defined in specific ranges
- The volume of the unit cell can be limited
- The lattice constants of a reduced cell will be given (Buerger cell/Niggli criteria)
- Graphic visualization of experimental and calculated peak positions
